## PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn a mirror for themselves in any VRChat world.
The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle optimised mirror
  * Configurable mirror size

__Changes in this fork__
More mirrors! Lazily added a 45 degree, ceiling and small mirror with UIX menu to control settings for (optimized and pickupable)
