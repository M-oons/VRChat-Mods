VRChat Mods

## AntiUdonExploits
This mod prevents certain exploits from affecting you in Udon worlds, such as global triggers.

## ComfyVRMenu
This mod will allow the big VRChat menu (Worlds, Social, etc) to open directly in front of your viewpoint when you are in VR, instead of down in it's default position. Useful for people who like laying down in VR and don't want to break their neck when trying to open the menu.

## PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn a mirror for themselves in any VRChat world.
The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle optimised mirror
  * Configurable mirror size
