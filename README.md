VRChat Mods

## ComfyVRMenu
This mod will allow the big VRChat menu (Worlds, Social, etc) to open directly in front of your viewpoint when you are in VR, instead of down in it's default position. Useful for people who like laying down in VR and don't want to break their neck when trying to open the menu.

## PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn a mirror for themselves in any VRChat world.
The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle optimised mirror
  * Configurable mirror size

## Udon't
This mod prevents global Udon triggers from affecting you.
The settings can be configured:
  * Enable/disable the mod completely
  * Enable the mod only in public instances

***Note:*** *This will likely break functionality in worlds that rely on these kinds of triggers to work properly, e.g. some game worlds.*
